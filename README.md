# Supply-Chain-Analytics-in-Tableau
Gotta love a data story that reveals both the challenges and the progress! 📊📉


My recent exercise with this “Just in Time” Inventory Dashboard offered a fascinating look at real-world supply chain dynamics. 🚚📦

We’ve tackled significant shipment delays (which are clearly improving since mid-2016! ✅), but the focus now shifts to addressing severely understocked products like Indoor/Outdoor Games 🕹️ and managing the ripple effects 
of fluctuating order volumes 📈.

The data makes one thing crystal clear: isolating a single metric is never enough. A holistic view of Supply & Demand, Delays, and Inventory Levels is essential for making sound, data-driven decisions. 💡📊
